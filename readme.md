Then, create a Track Suggester webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery) that asks future students a series of questions about themselves and provides a track suggestion based on their answers. You can ask questions about the languages themselves, the kinds of environments where these languages are used, or anything else you find relevant.

Include a minimum of 5 survey questions.
Offer 3 different track suggestions.
Don't forget regular Git commits and a detailed README. Commit messages should always be on-topic and professional in tone.
